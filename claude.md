## Development Guidelines

### Code Style & Conventions
- **JavaScript:** camelCase for variables/functions, descriptive names
- **Constants:** Organized in object literals (morseCode, commonWords, etc.)
- **Event Handling:** Event-driven with DOMContentLoaded initialization
- **State Management:** Simple object-based state tracking
- **Error Handling:** Console logging for debugging, try-catch for critical operations

### Naming Patterns
- Functions: `playTone()`, `generateCallsign()`, `checkAnswer()`
- State variables: `isPracticing`, `currentAnswer`, `isPlaying`
- UI elements: descriptive IDs matching their purpose (e.g., `copyModeSelect`, `checkAnswerBtn`)

### CSS Architecture
- Component-based class naming: `.practice-box`, `.stats-box`, `.settings-dropdown`
- Dark theme first with consistent color variables
- Smooth transitions and animations throughout
- Mobile-first responsive design

### Audio Implementation Details
- **Click Prevention:** 5ms attack/release envelope on all tones
- **Volume Safety:** Max gain clamped to 0.3 (30%) to prevent clipping
- **Precise Timing:** Web Audio API currentTime for scheduling accuracy
- **State Guards:** isPlaying flag prevents audio overlap
- **Shared Context:** All audio components use a single AudioContext for efficiency

### Amateur Radio Realism
- **Callsign Generator:**
  - 70% single-letter prefix (W, K, N, A)
  - 30% two-letter prefix (AA-AL, KA-KZ, NA-NZ, WA-WZ)
  - Weighted suffix lengths: 20% one letter, 40% two letters, 40% three letters
- **Q Codes:** 20 most common codes (QRL, QRM, QRN, QRO, QRP, QRS, QRT, QRZ, QSB, QSL, QSO, QSY, QTH, QRQ, QRV, QRX, QRK, QSK, QTC, QRU)
- **Common Words:** Mix of general English and ham radio terminology

## Development Workflow

### Local Development - Main Training Tools
1. Open [training/index.html](training/index.html) in a modern web browser
2. Make changes to HTML, CSS, or JS files
3. Refresh browser to see changes (no build step required)
4. Use browser DevTools console for debugging (extensive console.log statements in code)

### Local Development - QSO Simulator
1. Navigate to qso-simulator directory: `cd training/qso-simulator`
2. Install dependencies (first time only): `npm install`
3. Start development server: `npm start` (opens browser automatically at http://localhost:8080)
4. Make changes to files in `src/` directory
5. Webpack dev server auto-reloads on file changes
6. Build for production: `npm run build` (outputs to `dist/` directory)

### Testing Approach
- **Manual testing** in browser (no automated tests currently)
- Test across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Verify audio playback and timing accuracy
- Test responsive design at various screen sizes
- Verify all practice modes generate appropriate content
- **QSO Simulator:** Test multiple simultaneous audio streams and QSB/QRN effects
- **USB CW Key Testing:**
  - Test Left/Right Control keys for dit/dah input
  - Test bracket keys `[` and `]` as backup inputs
  - Verify all 4 keyer modes (straight, iambic A, iambic B, ultimatic)

## Technical Highlights

### Web Audio API Implementation
```javascript
// Initialize audio context
const audioContext = new (window.AudioContext || window.webkitAudioContext)();

// Create oscillator and gain nodes
const oscillator = audioContext.createOscillator();
const gainNode = audioContext.createGain();

// Precise timing using scheduled automation
gainNode.gain.setValueAtTime(0, startTime);
gainNode.gain.linearRampToValueAtTime(volume, startTime + attackTime);
gainNode.gain.setValueAtTime(volume, endTime - releaseTime);
gainNode.gain.linearRampToValueAtTime(0, endTime);
```

### PARIS Timing Standard
The application uses the PARIS standard for Morse code timing:
- 1 WPM = 50 dit units per minute (word "PARIS" = 50 dits)
- At 1 WPM, one dit = 1.2 seconds (1200 milliseconds)
- At N WPM, one dit = 1200 / N milliseconds

### USB CW Key Architecture
```javascript
// Keyer captures keyboard events
document.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
  keyer.press(event, true);  // Key down
});

document.addEventListener('keyup', (event) => {
  keyer.press(event, false); // Key up
});

// Decoder measures timing and converts to characters
decoder.keyOn();  // Start timing
decoder.keyOff(); // Calculate dit/dah and decode

// Sounder provides audio feedback
sounder.on();  // Smooth attack
sounder.off(); // Smooth release
```

### State Management Pattern
```javascript
const state = {
    isPracticing: false,
    currentAnswer: '',
    stats: { total: 0, correct: 0 }
};

// UI reflects state through enable/disable patterns
function updateUI() {
    startBtn.disabled = isPracticing;
    stopBtn.disabled = !isPracticing;
    checkAnswerBtn.disabled = !isPracticing;
}
```

Edit constants in [training/scripts/training.js](training/scripts/training.js) `getTimingFromWPM()` function:
- `ditTime`: Base unit for all timing (1200 / wpm)
- `dahTime`: 3× dit time
- `elementGap`: 1× dit time (between dits/dahs)
- `letterGap`: 3× dit time (between letters)
- `wordGap`: 7× dit time (between words)

### Modifying Color Scheme
Edit CSS custom properties in [training/training.css](training/training.css):
- Background: `#0a0a0a`
- Box background: `#1a1a1a`
- Text: `#e8e8e8`
- Accent: `#00d1b2` (Bulma turquoise)
- Borders: `#2a2a2a`

### Adding New Words or Q Codes
Edit arrays in [training/scripts/training.js](training/scripts/training.js):
- `commonWords`: Array of practice words (line ~30-130)
- `qCodes`: Array of Q code objects with code and description (line ~135-160)

### Modifying USB CW Key Mappings
Edit keyer initialization in [training/qso-simulator/src/js/morse-input/keyer.js](training/qso-simulator/src/js/morse-input/keyer.js):
- `ditKey1`: Primary dit key (currently 'ControlLeft')
- `dahKey1`: Primary dah key (currently 'ControlRight')
- `ditKey2`: Backup dit key (currently 'BracketLeft')
- `dahKey2`: Backup dah key (currently 'BracketRight')

## Debugging Tips

### Audio Issues
1. Check browser console for Web Audio API errors
2. Verify `audioContext.state === 'running'`
3. Test with different tone frequencies (400-1000 Hz range)
4. Check volume is not set to 0

### Timing Issues
1. Console logs show timing calculations in `playMorseSequence()`
2. Verify WPM setting is within 5-40 range
3. Check that `getTimingFromWPM()` returns expected values

### USB CW Key Issues
1. Check browser console for keyboard event logging
2. Verify keyer mode is set correctly (1-4)
3. Test with both Control keys and bracket keys
4. Check sidetone volume is not set to 0
5. Ensure morse input is initialized (click CQ button first)
6. Verify decoder timing thresholds match expected WPM

### UI State Issues
1. Check `isPracticing` flag state
2. Verify event listeners are properly attached
3. Use browser DevTools to inspect button disabled states

## Best Practices

### When Modifying Code
- Maintain consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Add console.log statements for debugging
- Test audio timing with metronome/reference
- Verify mobile responsiveness after UI changes
- Keep dark theme consistent across new components

### When Adding Features
- Follow existing event-driven patterns
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add comments for complex timing or audio logic
- Test across multiple browsers
- Consider mobile users (touch interactions, screen size)

### Code Organization
- Keep related functionality grouped together
- Separate concerns: audio, UI, practice logic
- Use small, focused functions
- Avoid global variables where possible
- Document any non-obvious algorithms

## Contributing Guidelines

### Code Quality
- Write clean, readable code with consistent formatting
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep functions focused and small
- Test thoroughly before committing

### Amateur Radio Standards
- Maintain PARIS timing standard accuracy
- Use realistic callsign patterns
- Include appropriate Q codes and abbreviations
- Follow amateur radio conventions

### User Experience
- Maintain dark theme for eye comfort
- Keep UI simple and uncluttered
- Provide immediate feedback for user actions
- Ensure responsive design works on mobile
- Consider accessibility in all UI changes
